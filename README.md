# eu4-x10-ideas
Script for taking the various Ideas in EU4 and multiplying their values by 10.

ex,  France Idea "Elan" goes from the original +15% Morale to +150% Morale.
But for ALL National Ideas (incl. Ambition and Tradition) and Idea Groups.

Why? It's funny, and makes for a few absolutely chaotic - if not very entertaining - games. 
Prussian Space Marines are even more terrifying, 
Spain and Portugal colonize the Americas in 1/20th of the usual time, 
Great Britain will never lose a naval engagement,
just your usual EU4 OPness, except even more so.
